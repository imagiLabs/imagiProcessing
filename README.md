## What is Processing?

[Processing](https://processing.org/#:~:text=Processing%20is%20a%20flexible%20software,and%20visual%20literacy%20within%20technology.) is a "flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts". Similarly to imagiLabs coding IDE, you can make and run creative coding projects in Processing.

## How to write the code in Processing?

Processing [uses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_(programming_language)) the "Java language, with additional simplifications such as additional classes and aliased mathematical functions and operations. It also provides a graphical user interface for simplifying the compilation and execution stage". Recently, Processing also started to support Python.

## What are some resources to learn Processing?

My personal favorite is the [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) YouTube Channel, where you can learn all of the basic programming concepts for Processing in Java and p5 JavaScript library.
